My Google Doodle

My google doodle is set in a witches den. She left for a moment but she is cooking up something deadly in he couldren. It's a very foggy night her window is open and the wind is pushing air through the feather on her hat that she left on the table. A spider hangs down from the roof slowly moving while green sludge bubbles pop from her mixture.
